# Expense-Account

To implement features such as signup, signin, Gmail verification, profile management, and task addition in your Expense-Account project, hereâ€™s a structured approach you can follow:

1. User Authentication (Signup/Signin)
Signup:

Use Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign up with their email and password.
Signin:

Implement sign-in functionality to allow users to log in using their credentials.
 Gmail Verification
After signing up, send a verification email to the user's Gmail.
Store user profile information (name, email, etc.) in Firebase Firestore after signup.
 Adding Expense Tasks
Create a form where users can add their expense tasks, which includes fields like title, amount,price and date.
